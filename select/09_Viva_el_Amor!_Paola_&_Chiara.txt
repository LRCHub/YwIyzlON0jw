Everything is right
At night
In our room
Then I think that we'd be just fine spending time
But it's too soon
Taking the heat
Cause your love is so sweet
Dreaming through the night
Hold on thight
Viva el amor
We're touching the tip of the desire
Viva el amor
It's taking us higher and higher
One look and I'm yours
That pull between us
Making me feel strange in a way I can't say
But it's just
When your not here
Something I cannot bear
I'm dreaming through the night
Hold on tight
Viva el amor
We're touching the tip of the desire
Viva el amor
It's taking us higher and higher
Viva el amor
Now something is taking me over
Viva el amor
This magic is bringing us closer
How do you feel all that's left is unreal
I am in your hands
You show me a way to keep loving you each day
Viva el amor
We're touching the tip of the desire
Viva el amor
It's taking us higher and higher
Viva el amor
Now something is taking me over
Viva el amor
This magic is bringing us closer
